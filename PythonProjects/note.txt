This is where I have some Python projects. You will not need any external libraries, unless I add a requirements.txt in that folder. 

As a reminder, the command to install all the required python libraries are below, depending on OS:

Windows:
pip install -r requirements.txt

MacOS/Linux/Android (via Termux)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
